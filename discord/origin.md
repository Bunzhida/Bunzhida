# Origin
Hello! This is basically the entry point of me visiting Discord, you'll hear a lot of incomplete parts so if something goes off, don't be surprised
## Dancing Line Fan-Mades
This is one of the factor when I joined Discord, Dancing Line is a mobile game that only includes tapping the screen, so- it's a one input
rhythm/arcade game

Most of the creators didn't send the download links of their fanmades in YouTube descriptions but in their Discord servers so I made a new
account just to download them and try them out.

This is also the start of my game dev journey because when I found out they made the fanmades with Unity, I also want to try them out
I joined these kinds of server ever since 2018 under the name of NRCorp, if you look for "Dancing Line Fanmade NRCorp" you could probably find
one of my first cringy levels.

The first server I joined was called "Dancing Line Discord" made by Benztar, or Ash. But then transferred to Azure in which doesn't have an online
presence anymore..

Time by time, the server got renamed to "Rhythm Games Hub" and the server ownership changed again to someone else. But then the server got deleted
by Skye, this is one of the fall of the Dancing Line empire (so dramatic). Because now the archives of fanmades are lost thus can never be recovered

The server got remade again but then the server owner decided to gave up and delete it again.
It's end of life is marked at 2021.
## The Dragon's Maw (TW: VORE)
This server is one of the biggest vore servers before, I joined this server since 2019 under the name of Fish_Neat in which became my
FurAffinity username now (why can't I change my username TvT). From here, I started to get interested in drawing and started making actual
friends I talk with and fix/improve my English skills. Apparently this also made me interested in roleplaying and so I do a bunch of it.

Sadly this is one of the server where the 18+ ID verification is required after the mass-reports on vore servers happens, explained in [this document here](Vore18.md).
And with new members coming in, the server became more toxic, it's not the fault of the owner really. The owner is actually quite kind
but after that, in 2020. I lost contact with the server.
## MediaPlay Discord
I also found some friends here too! This is where I really started to get interested in rhythm games, because the people there are challenging themselves
with who can get the highest scores, there are also currencies, items and some fun stuff you can do in the server. Owned by TechNewVideo aka NeoTechVideo

At 2020, I abandoned the account because of the [StarberryGoatcake drama](StarberryGoatcake.md)...
More interesting stuff happens, the owner got a mental breakdown! Now the server is messed up and people are leaving
2021-2022 is an intense year for MPD, two owners of MPD fight each other on who is the best at managing servers

In the end nobody really wins, and MPD has now become a legacy.
