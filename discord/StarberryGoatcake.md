# Starberry Goatcake (Also known as Jackie)
She is an amazing artist I'm gonna say, this drama is entirely my fault for doing so. I'm just going to start on that

I was invited by her to a server so that I can talk and discuss about art and improve, get advice or give advices. It was a pretty chill server with people mostly just sharing art or talking!
She also has her best friend, I don't know if it's still the case but I forgot what their name is.

I kept on talking there, mostly being ignored but that's to be expected...
Altho I was in a really left-out mood for everything, and instead of holding it, I burst out and started DM-ing Jackie and blaming on her for everything she haven't done

It was a really stupid move

Jackie started to also vent in the server publicly, putting a really bad image over me and my name. I as a minor tried to protect myself but apparently it doen't work.
Even recalling this event still hurts me the deepest because of how much regret I had to handle, supported with Jackie being all dramatic making the situation worse

And silly me tried to set things up, I made her to go in quite a bad mood so I just let them to do stuff. I talked a bit and apologized and we never really talked much since.
I really missed talking with her

After a while, the server disappeared from my server list. I'm not sure if I'm banned, kicked, or the server got deleted. And if you know about it please tell me-
I then changed my account to another one, named Bunzhida and stopped using Paffo for a little while...
