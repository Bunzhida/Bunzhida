# After Bunzhida
You probably know me because of my bat OC named Yoku, or you still didn't know the character's name is actually that
People called me Bunzi or Bunz nowadays and I'm getting much more used to it then my previous usernames

I started on drawing since 2019 so it's no surprise that my art isn't really amateur when I started posting on [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bunzhida)
Jem and someone else actually had helped me in the process of making my OC, so thanks to them really

If you know me in this era then you probably only see me being normal and not so edgy or depressing, unless if you're one of my close friends. I do thank you all of you for staying in contact with me!
I didn't really know what to say much, so I guess thank you so much for reading this!
