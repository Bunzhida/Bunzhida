# Before Bunzhida
I was originally named as ReDark Technology, I'm much more interested in programming and making levels
Altho since I discovered vore, I found an interest into it and started on drawing!

I made a lot of weird bad artworks back then, if you want to see it, it's all in [here](https://furaffinity.net/user/fishneat)

It has been going for around 3 years, I'm still around 13-15 around those times

Mainly I used Paffo - The pink dragon if anyone recognized that, and I've been using it a lot. Anyone usually recognized me whenever I used it
Although two drama occurs in this era, the one is with [Marcy and Cookie](CookieMarcy.md). Mentally drained me and really confuses me here and there.

That's one of the big drama I'm involved into, although I'm also then involved with [StarberryGoatcake](StarberryGoatcake.md) which leads me to make a new user,
and so decided to change my name to Bunzhida and make it so that it could be distinguished from other usernames

My previous account I used for that is still alive and used today, it's ReDark Technology#3425
