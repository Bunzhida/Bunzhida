# Cookie and Marcy drama
I don't even know what happened, I just suddenly got involved because I'm in their friend list and have been quite close with Cookie before
These are also sorta common names, so you might not even be involved in this

If you two still wanted to get in contact with me, just use another name. I really don't want to see those names again

At first, I and Cookie was making a vore server called The Vore Theatre. It was pretty dead until then Marcy came in and invited other active people and then it become really active!
It was really good for us since now we thought we have a maintanable server, I'm still 14 or 15 at this time so I'm still immature about things.

Later on around this time, Marcy and Cookie got in drama with each other for manipulation and accusations, maybe it's false accusations or maybe it's true.
A lot of informations were sent, I was being played around by those two by making me to pick both sides

Basically Marcy just took a lot of Cookie's friends away from him and that made him depressed and suicidal, both have been asking for help to me and also threatened me so I was pretty confused and afraid.
In this situation I'm being manipulated by a lot, although since I can't recall a lot of it. They also accussed me of stuff, mostly Marcy since Cookie usually just vented towards me

I don't know if I ever did anything wrong to them, Benji [one of Marcy's best friend] also is mad at me for some reason. I'm really confused at that
The server ownership got transferred to Marcy and Cookie left, I was there as a moderator for a bit but then I got tired of the drama and left

I really don't know what happened next after that...
